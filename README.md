# JuniorScript 3

Setup
---

#### Quick Start
If you quickly need to add JuniorScript to your site, just paste this at the end of the body tag:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://juniorscript.com/juniorscript.js">`

#### Download

You can download JuniorScript [here](https://github.com/JuniorCode/JuniorScript/zipball/master), and then source it at the end of the body tag.

`<script src="jrs.min.js"></script>`

Now test it out by pasting this in your HTML.

`<script type="text/juniorscript">print JuniorScript works!</script>`

The result should be `JuniorScript works!`. If not, ensure it is placed before the JuniorScript file.

Using JuniorScript
---
You can also run JuniorScript directly from JavaScript, like this.

`$("print Wow, that's cool!");`
