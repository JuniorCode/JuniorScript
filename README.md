# JuniorScript

Setup
---
To use JuniorScript, first source it at the end of your body tag in your HTML.

`<script src="juniorscript.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`

Now add your first command.

`<juniorscript>out It works!</juniorscript>`

The result should be `It works!`. If not, **ensure the script tag is at the end of the body tag.**
